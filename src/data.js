        description: "San Francisco is by far my most favorite city in the US. You can take a cable car to the Fisherman's Wharf, greet the sea lions on Pier 39. If you like art, Legion of Honor is your go-to. For dinner, make sure to check out the fried Dungeness Crab at R&G Lounge. Day 2 starts at the Ferry Building. You get to enjoy Golden Bridge view with fresh baked pastries at Acme Bread Company. It only takes 20 minutes to get to the nearby island town Sausalito. Last day I always have dim sum before heading to the airport, Dragon Beaux is a must-try.",

        description: "Vancouver is in its best season in September. Compared to the US, the city planning is an A+, and people are so peaceful. You can take a hop-on hop-off bus to visit gas town. After some shopping, consider a laid-back horse ride at Stanley park. If you like Chinese food, make sure to check out Richmond. Vancouver also has Vancouver Island which is the largest island on the Pacific coast of North America. There is a city built on Vancouver island called Victoria, which has Craigdarroch Castle and Butchart Garden. ",
